## Introduction

"++C" is a C++ based programming/scripting language, created as a demonstration of using postfix notation in programming syntax. 

The ++C interpreter currently supports only the following:
1. The 3 datatypes int, string, and bool
2. Basic arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
3. Variable declaration and assignment
4. Comments
5. Basic input/output with cout and cin

### Note
_In order for the ++C interpreter to support more functionalities without becoming large and cumbersome, the source code would need to be overhauled to rely less on C++ constructs and more on actual lower-level logic. The current interpreter represents ++C variables as elements of C++ lists, with each datatype having it's own list. Directly allocating memory and creating pointers would be much more efficient and scalable than using C++ lists, but would require an overhaul of the current interpreter._
